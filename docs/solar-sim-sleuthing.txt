Basilisk notes::
I've spent some time looking through the old oresat solar simulator software branch in hopes I could
find some use in their scripts, perhaps use their basilisk modules, and hopefull determine what we
can depricate or use in the pico conversion.

My goal is to provide supplementary documentation for the current solar sim team. 

**** File sleuthing by file ****
oresat-solar-simulator-software/hub/
 1. Basilisk scripts*:
 	1.1. BSK-LEOrbit.py 
 		- A solar sim using CSS sensors (and spoofed data, I presume)
 	1.2.1 oresatStream.py 
 		- The same solar sim, now with the magnetic field data included.
 		  it seems they attempted to create an oresat 'hub' that could carry out
		  both HC sim and solar sim
	1.2.2 out.json
		- This is an output file for the basilisk script, oresatStream.py.
		  supposedly this contains solar data from the CSS script
note: for reference refer to the following  basilisk demos:
 scenarioBasicOrbit.py, scenerioCSS.py, scenerioMagneticFieldCenteredDipole.py

 2. Solar Sim Hub:
 	2.1. solar-sim-hub.py
 		- NOT a basilisk script. This program seems to be intended as a host client used to
 		  control the solar simulator and HC magnetic simulators. Uses socketio to communicate
 		  with the pocket beagle.
 	2.2. hub-options.conf
 		- config file used by the solar-sim-hub.py. Provides inputs for the arguments...
 		  Args:
 		  -f, --file    : 'uses simple rotation rather than basilisk model' DEFAULT: out.json
 		  -p, --port    : 'port hub is listening on' (beagle port) DEFAULT: 
 		  -r, --refresh : 'sets refresh rate in seconds' DEFAULT:
 		  clients       : 'number of simulator clients connected' DEFAULT: 4
 		  -v, --verbose : 'verbose mode'
 		  -s, -safe     : 'engages safe mode, limits output and turns UV off'
 	2.3. requirements.txt
 		- Module requirements for solar-sim-hub. cat requirements.txt gives,
 		  python-engineio==4.3.*
		  python-socketio==5.8.*
		  eventlet==0.33.*
		- found that I also needed the package: dnspython==2.2.1
			installed using : pip install dnspython==2.2.1
